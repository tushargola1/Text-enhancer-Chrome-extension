# Text-enhancer-Chrome-extension


It features a user interface with options for language translation, text formatting (uppercase, lowercase, summarization, space removal), and speech synthesis. Users can choose from a variety of languages and modes, including a free rewriter and summarizer. The interface provides a textarea for input and displays word count, along with buttons for speech, copying, and clearing the text. The component communicates with translation and summarization APIs, handling user interactions and rendering UI elements dynamically. This versatile tool is intended for Chrome extension users seeking efficient text processing and language transformation.
I have used two API in this project which is translator api and text summerizer api from rapid api.
